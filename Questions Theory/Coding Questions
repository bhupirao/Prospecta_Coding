Coding Questions

Question:Â What are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable? (In coding)

   When build or consuming an API, ensuring security and reliability is crucial.

   1. Security :-> 

      - Authentication and Authorization:

           API Keys/Bearer Tokens: Securely manage API keys or bearer tokens used for authentication. Ensure they are not hardcoded in the codebase or exposed in version control.
           OAuth: For more complex scenarios, consider using OAuth for secure and scalable authorization.

      - Input Validation:
      
           Sanitize Inputs: Validate and sanitize all inputs to avoid injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
           Parameter Constraints: Implement constraints and checks on query parameters, request bodies, and path variables.                  
      
      - Error Handling:

           Avoid Detailed Error Messages: Avoid exposing internal server errors or stack traces to end users. Provide generic error messages while logging detailed errors internally.
      
      - HTTPS:

           Secure Communication: Always use HTTPS for secure communication between clients and your API. This encrypts data transmitted over the network.

      - CORS:
           
           Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Configure CORS settings to control which domains can access your API, helping prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.


    
   2. Reliability :->
   

      - Error Handling and Logging:
 					
 				Graceful Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected situations and failures. Return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages.
				Logging: Use logging to capture and diagnose errors, performance issues, and other operational metrics.

	 -  Monitoring and Alerts:
	            
	            Application Monitoring: Use monitoring tools to track API performance, health, and usage. Set up alerts for critical issues such as high error rates or performance degradation.

	 - Testing:

	            Unit and Integration Testing: Write comprehensive tests for your API endpoints to ensure they work correctly and handle edge cases.
	            Load Testing: Perform load testing to evaluate how the API handles high traffic and to identify potential bottlenecks.

	 - Documentation:

	            API Documentation: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for your API, including usage examples, endpoint descriptions, and response formats. Tools like Swagger (OpenAPI) can help with automated documentation.
